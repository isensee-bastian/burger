# Burger Challenge

## Improvement ideas

* Replace sauces like ketchup and mayo with more clearly recognizable images, same for the onions (could be mistaken as tomatoes or cheese, especially when moving).
* Instead of stacking one burger at a time catching the parts at the bottom, consider controlling where the ingredients fall for building multiple stacks.
